 ## [Video Demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZ6HTZW-fkZRlJFb354HBnNDQg95EXE1/view?usp=sharing)

<h2>Description</h2>
In a DoS attack, attackers flood a victim’s system with nonlegitimate service requests or traffic to overload its resources and collapse the system, leading to the unavailability of the victim’s website or at least significantly reducing the victim’s system or network performance.<br><br>

DoS attacks may result in the over consumption of resources, bandwidth, disk space, CPU time, or data structures; they may also cause the actual physical destruction or alteration of network components or the destruction of programming and files in a computer system.<br>

This lab demonstrates how to perform a DoS attack on a target machine using hping3.
